# basic-bookmark-saver

This is one of the project of a 15 Project Series made by Codesistency on Youtube. I'm currently learning by following along with this YouTube video, which covers a HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm taking notes, coding along, adding my own touch to it and documenting what I learn here in this repository. This is a work in progress as I continue watching and practicing each section.

## Features

- Add bookmarks with a title and URL
- View a list of all saved bookmarks
- Open bookmarks directly from the app
- Delete bookmarks you no longer need
- Data persists in browser localStorage

In this project, I learned how to handle form inputs, interact with browser localStorage, and dynamically update the DOM. I also practiced using array methods like `.filter` to manage and display data. This project helped me understand the basics of CRUD operations in a simple web app.
